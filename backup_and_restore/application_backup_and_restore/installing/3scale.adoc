Red Hat 3scale API Management (APIM) makes it easy to manage your APIs for internal or external users. Share, secure, distribute, control, and monetize your APIs on an infrastructure platform built with performance, customer control, and future growth in mind.

3scale components can be deployed on-premise, in the cloud, as aÂ managed service, or in any combination required.

This document describes how the {oadp-first} Operator can be used to back up and restore 3scale with on-cluster storage.

The backup scenario covers a situation where you are not using custom domains, and you need to recover to a cluster with a different domain than the source cluster.

The flow of backup in this document is divided into 3 phases:

. Backup and restore of the {oadp-short} Operator
. Backup and restore of the 3scale data
. Backup and restore of the capabilities


The backup is completed in multiple phases for the purpose of clean explanation of the entire flow but can potentially be done in a single phase using a more sophisticated version of Backup CR.

However, the restoration must be done in a few phases due to how the 3scale-Operator interacts with the APIM and general operator installation flow.

[NOTE]
====
Enable Restic when creating the DataProtectionApplication (DPA) custom resource (CR) as this is what it used to perform the backup and restoration of the PVs. Enabling Restic must be completed on both the source cluster and the destination cluster.
