You can use OADP 1.2 Data Mover to backup and restore application data for clusters that use CephFS, CephRBD, or both.

OADP 1.2 Data Mover leverages Ceph features that support large-scale environments. One of these is the shallow copy method, which is available for {product-title} 4.12 and later. This feature supports backing up and restoring `StorageClass` and `AccessMode` resources other than what is found on the source persistent volume claim (PVC).

[IMPORTANT]
====
The CephFS shallow copy feature is a back up feature. It is not part of restore operations.
