For OADP 1.1 Data Mover, you must perform a data cleanup after you perform a backup.

The cleanup consists of deleting the following resources:

* Snapshots in a bucket
* Cluster resources
* Volume snapshot backups (VSBs) after a backup procedure that is either run by a schedule or is run repetitively

OADP 1.1 Data Mover might leave cluster resources whether or not it successfully backs up your container storage interface (CSI) volume snapshots to a remote object store.
