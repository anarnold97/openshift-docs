As a cluster administrator, you use the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) by installing the OADP Operator. The OADP Operator installs link:https://{velero-domain}/docs/v{velero-version}/[Velero {velero-version}], and OpenShift plugins for Velero to use, for backup and restore operations.
// velevro is an attribute, we must ensure we ask for the relevant version of Velero when there is a release so it is correctly updated.

You should not install multiple versions of OADP in the same cluster. Each OADP version can have different custom resource definitions. Only one version of OADP will work properly if you install multiple OADP versions in the same cluster. Therefore, it is recommended to have a single version of OADP (and Velero) installed in the cluster.

It is permissible to install OADP alongside the Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC), provided that the version of OADP installed is identical to the version of OADP that is dependent on MTC. For example, you cannot install OADP 1.1 along with MTC 1.7, which expects OADP 1.0. In this scenario, you can only install OADP 1.0

To back up Kubernetes resources and internal images, you must have object storage as a backup location, such as one of the following storage types:

* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#installing-oadp-aws[Amazon Web Services]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-azure.adoc#installing-oadp-azure[Microsoft Azure]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-gcp.adoc#installing-oadp-gcp[Google Cloud Platform]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-mcg.adoc#installing-oadp-mcg[Multicloud Object Gateway]
* AWS S3 compatible object storage, such as Noobaa or Minio

You can back up persistent volumes (PVs) by using snapshots or Restic.

To back up PVs with snapshots, you must have a cloud provider that supports either a native snapshot API or Container Storage Interface (CSI) snapshots, such as one of the following cloud providers:

* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#installing-oadp-aws[Amazon Web Services]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-azure.adoc#installing-oadp-azure[Microsoft Azure]
* xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-gcp.adoc#installing-oadp-gcp[Google Cloud Platform]
* CSI snapshot-enabled cloud provider, such as xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-ocs.adoc#installing-oadp-ocs[OpenShift Data Foundation]

include::snippets/oadp-ocp-compat.adoc[]

If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your storage is NFS, you can back up applications with xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-backing-up-applications-restic_backing-up-applications[Restic backups] on object storage.

You create a default `Secret` and then you install the Data Protection Application.
