OADP Data Mover allows you to backup container storage interface (CSI) volume snapshots to a remote object store.

When Data Mover is enabled, you can restore stateful applications from the store if a failure, accidental deletion, or corruption of the cluster occurs.

OADP Data Mover solution uses the Restic option of VolSync.
