OADP Data Mover allows you to backup container storage interface (CSI) volume snapshots to a remote object store.

When Data Mover is enabled, you can restore stateful applications from the store if a failure, accidental deletion, or corruption of the cluster occurs.

OADP Data Mover solution uses the Restic option of VolSync.

[NOTE]
====
The OADP 1.1 Data Mover is a Technology Preview feature.

It is recommended that you utilize the OADP 1.2 Data Mover to backup and restore ODF CephFS volumes, upgrade or install OCP 4.12 for enhanced performance. The OADP Data Mover can leverage CephFS shallow volumes in OCP 4.12 or later, which, based on our testing, is an improvement in the performance of backup times.

.Prerequisites

* You have a stateful application running in a separate namespace.

* You have installed the OADP Operating.

* You have created an appropriate `volumeSnapshotClass` and `storageClass`.

* You have installed the VolSync operator using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
