You back up applications by creating a `Backup` custom resource (CR). See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/oadp-creating-backup-cr-doc.adoc#oadp-creating-backup-cr-doc[Creating a Backup CR].

The `Backup` CR creates backup files for Kubernetes resources and internal images, on S3 object storage, and snapshots for persistent volumes (PVs), if the cloud provider uses a native snapshot API or the Container Storage Interface (CSI) to create snapshots, such as {rh-storage} 4.

For more information about CSI volume snapshots, see xref:../../../storage/container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-snapshots.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-snapshots[CSI volume snapshots].

include::snippets/technology-preview.adoc[]

* If your cloud provider has a native snapshot API or supports CSI snapshots, the `Backup` CR backs up persistent volumes (PVs) by creating snapshots. For more information about working with CSI snapshots, see xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/oadp-backing-up-pvs-csi-doc.adoc#oadp-backing-up-pvs-csi-doc[Backing up persistent volumes with CSI snapshots].

* If your cloud provider does not support snapshots or if your applications are on NFS data volumes, you can create backups by using Restic. See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/oadp-backing-up-applications-restic-doc.adoc#oadp-backing-up-applications-restic-doc[Backing up applications with Restic].

[IMPORTANT]
====
The {oadp-first} does not support backing up volume snapshots that were created by other software.
====

You can create backup hooks to run commands before or after the backup operation. See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-creating-backup-hooks_backing-up-applications[Creating backup hooks].

You can schedule backups by creating a `Schedule` CR instead of a `Backup` CR. See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#oadp-scheduling-backups_backing-up-applications[Scheduling backups].
