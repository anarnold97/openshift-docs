You can employ OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) with Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) clusters to backup and restore application data.

ROSA is a fully-managed, turnkey application platform that allows you to focus on delivering value to your customers by building and deploying applications.

ROSA provides seamless integration with a wide range of AWS compute, database, analytics, machine learning, networking, mobile, and other services to further accelerate the building and delivering of differentiating experiences to your customers.

You subscribe to the service directly from your AWS account.

After the clusters are created, you can operate your clusters with the OpenShift web console or through {cluster-manager-first}. The ROSA service also uses OpenShift APIs and command-line interface (CLI) tools.
