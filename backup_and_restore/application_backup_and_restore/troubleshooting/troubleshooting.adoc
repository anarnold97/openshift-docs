== OADP Backup and Restore CR issues

If you encounter issues with `Backup` and `Restore` custom resources (CRs), see:

* The `Backup` CR displays the error message, `InvalidVolume.NotFound: The volume ‘vol-xxxx’ does not exist`. See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/oadp-backup-restore-cr-issues-doc.adoc#backup-cannot-retrieve-volume-doc[Backup CR cannot retrieve volume].
* The status of a `Backup` CR remains in the `InProgress` phase and does not complete. See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/oadp-backup-restore-cr-issues-doc.adoc#backup-cr-remains-in-progress-doc[Backup CR status remains in progress].
* The status of a `Backup` CR without Restic in use remains in the `PartiallyFailed` phase and does not complete. A snapshot of the affiliated PVC is not created. See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/oadp-backup-restore-cr-issues-doc.adoc#backup-cr-remains-partiallyfailed-doc[Backup CR status remains in PartiallyFailed].


[id="oadp-restic-issues-para"]
== Restic issues

If you encounter issues when you back up applications with Restic, see:

* The `Restic` pod log displays the error message: `controller=pod-volume-backup error="fork/exec/usr/bin/restic: permission denied"`. See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/oadp-restic-issues-doc.adoc#restic-permission-error-nfs-root-squash-enabled-doc[Restic permission error for NFS data volumes with root_squash enabled].
* If you create a Restic `Backup` CR for a namespace, empty the object storage bucket, and then recreate the `Backup` CR for the same namespace, the recreated `Backup` CR fails. See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/oadp-restic-issues-doc.adoc#restic-backup-cannot-be-recreated-after-s3-bucket-emptied-doc[Restic Backup CR cannot be recreated after bucket is emptied].

[id="oadp-must-gather-issues-para"]
== Using the must-gather tool

You can collect logs, metrics, and information about {local-product} custom resources by using the `must-gather` tool. The `must-gather` archive is a collection of cluster resources and logs that after is ran, it creates a directory in the current working directory. Then the object is automatically deleted. See xref:../../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/troubleshooting/migration-using-must-gather-doc.adoc#migration-using-must-gather-doc[must-gather tool].
