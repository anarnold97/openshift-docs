[role="_abstract"]
Your job as a cluster administrator is to protect your applications and data in a way that aligns with your specific infrastructure and use cases. This means you need tools that are both powerful and extensible. {oadp-full}'s strength lies in its ability to meet this need by leveraging a variety of plugins that support different cloud providers, storage solutions, and application types.

{oadp-short}'s design, based on the open-source Velero project, allows it to perform several critical jobs:

* Backup: Create point-in-time copies of your application's Kubernetes resources, internal images, and persistent volumes.

* Restore: Recover data from a backup in a disaster scenario or for migration purposes.

* Schedule: Automate recurring backups to ensure continuous data protection.

* Storage Management: Define where your backups and snapshots are stored using BackupStorageLocation and VolumeSnapshotLocation.

{oadp-short}'s extensibility, provided through its plugins, is crucial for accomplishing these jobs across diverse environments.

{oadp-short} features provide options for backing up and restoring applications.

The default plugins enable Velero to integrate with certain cloud providers and to back up and restore {product-title} resources.

== OADP support for {ibm-power-title} and {ibm-z-title}

{oadp-short} is platform neutral. The information that follows relates only to {ibm-power-name} and to {ibm-z-name}.

* {oadp-short} {oadp-version-1-3} was tested successfully against {product-title} 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, and 4.15 for both {ibm-power-name} and {ibm-z-name}. The sections that follow give testing and support information for {oadp-short} {oadp-version-1-3} in terms of backup locations for these systems.
* {oadp-short} {oadp-version-1-4} was tested successfully against {product-title} 4.14, 4.15, 4.16, and 4.17 for both {ibm-power-name} and {ibm-z-name}. The sections that follow give testing and support information for {oadp-short} {oadp-version-1-4} in terms of backup locations for these systems.
* {oadp-short} {oadp-version-1-5} was tested successfully against {product-title} 4.19 for both {ibm-power-name} and {ibm-z-name}. The sections that follow give testing and support information for {oadp-short} {oadp-version-1-5} in terms of backup locations for these systems.
