The {oadp-first} product is intended to safeguard customer applications on the OpenShift Platform. OADP provides disaster recovery protection for OpenShift applications, application related cluster resources, persistent volumes, and internal images. OADP can be used to back up containerized applications and virtual machines (VMs).

OADP is not intended to be a disaster recovery solution for *etcd* or OpenShift Operators.

There exists a multitude of approaches to customize a backup to avoid backing up inappropriate resources by using namespaces or labels.

OADP provides the following APIs:

* Backup
* Restore
* Schedule
* BackupStorageLocation
* VolumeSnapshotLocation

// once finished come back and add doc links to the APIs
