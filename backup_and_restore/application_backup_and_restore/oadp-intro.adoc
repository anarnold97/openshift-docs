The {oadp-first} product safeguards customer applications on {product-title}. OADP provides disaster recovery protection for {product-title} applications, application-related cluster resources, persistent volumes, and internal images.

OADP can be used to back up containerized applications and virtual machines (VMs).

OADP cannot be used as a disaster recovery solution for etcd or OpenShift Operators. For more information on etcd, see xref:../../backup_and_restore/control_plane_backup_and_restore/backing-up-etcd.adoc#backup-etcd[Backing up etcd].

OADP provides APIs to enable multiple approaches to customize a backup to avoid backing up inappropriate resources.

OADP provides the following APIs:

* xref:../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/backing-up-applications.adoc#backing-up-applications[Backup]
* xref:../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/backing_up_and_restoring/restoring-applications.adoc#restoring-applications[Restore]
* xref:../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/oadp-api.adoc#oadp-api[Schedule]
* BackupStorageLocation
* VolumeSnapshotLocation

// once finished re-work come back and add doc links to the APIs
