== New features

.Resource timeouts
The new `resourceTimeout` option specifies the timeout duration in minutes for waiting on various Velero resources. This option applies to resources such as Velero CRD availability, `volumeSnapshot` deletion, and backup repository availability. The default duration is ten minutes.

.AWS S3 compatible backup storage providers
You can back up objects and snapshots on AWS S3 compatible providers. For more details, see xref:../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#migration-configuring-aws-s3_installing-oadp-aws[Configuring Amazon Web Services].

=== Technical preview features

.Data Mover
The OADP Data Mover enables you to back up Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots to a remote object store. When you enable Data Mover, you can restore stateful applications using CSI volume snapshots pulled from the object store in case of accidental cluster deletion, cluster failure, or data corruption. For more information, see xref:../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/oadp-using-data-mover-for-csi-snapshots-doc.adoc#oadp-using-data-mover-for-csi-snapshots-doc[Using Data Mover for CSI snapshots].

[id="known-issues-1-2-0_{context}"]
== Known issues

The following issue has been highlighted as known issues in the release of OADP 1.2.0:

.Generated routes can have an incorrect hostname on restore if hostname had been modified

A generated route which has the annotation `openshift.io/host.generated: 'true'` is assumed to have its `.spec.host` value populated by the cluster and unmodified by the user. If the user has modified the host value from the generated value, the host value can be lost on restore.

There is no mechanism at this time in OADP to dynamically set route host value based on cluster base domain name for a non generated route.

Likewise, for a generated route, the host value will be stripped by the OADP operator, and regenerated on restore cluster. Any modifications to its `.spec.host` of a generated route will be lost on restore.
