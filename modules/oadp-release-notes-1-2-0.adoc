You can back up objects and snapshots on AWS S3 compatible providers. For more details, see xref:../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#migration-configuring-aws-s3_installing-oadp-aws[Configuring Amazon Web Services].

.Data Mover
The OADP Data Mover enables you to back up Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots to a remote object store. When you enable Data Mover, you can restore stateful applications using CSI volume snapshots pulled from the object store in case of accidental cluster deletion, cluster failure, or data corruption. For more information, see xref:../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/oadp-using-data-mover-for-csi-snapshots-doc.adoc#oadp-using-data-mover-for-csi-snapshots-doc[Using Data Mover for CSI snapshots].

[id="known-issues-1-2-0_{context}"]
== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

.Modifying a hostname in a generated route can create an incorrect hostname upon restoring the cluster

By default, OpenShift cluster adds the`openshift.io/host.generated: 'true'` annotation and populates the value for the `.spec.host` field in the generated and non generated routes. 

You cannot modify the value for the `.spec.host` field based on the base domain name of your cluster in the generated and non generated routes.

If you modify the value for the `.spec.host` field, you cannot restore the default value populated by the OpenShift cluster. The OADP operator regenrates the value for `.spec.host` field after you restore your OpenShift cluster.
