You can back up objects and snapshots on AWS S3 compatible providers. For more details, see xref:../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/installing-oadp-aws.adoc#migration-configuring-aws-s3_installing-oadp-aws[Configuring Amazon Web Services].

.Data Mover
The OADP Data Mover enables you to back up Container Storage Interface (CSI) volume snapshots to a remote object store. When you enable Data Mover, you can restore stateful applications using CSI volume snapshots pulled from the object store in case of accidental cluster deletion, cluster failure, or data corruption. For more information, see xref:../../backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/oadp-using-data-mover-for-csi-snapshots-doc.adoc#oadp-using-data-mover-for-csi-snapshots-doc[Using Data Mover for CSI snapshots].

[id="known-issues-1-2-0_{context}"]
== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

.An incorrect hostname can be created when changing a hostname in a generated route.

By default, OpenShift cluster makes sure that the openshift.io/host.generated: `true` annotation is turned on and fills in the field for both the routes that are generated and those that are not generated.

You cannot modify the value for the `.spec.host` field based on the base domain name of your cluster in the generated and non-generated routes.

If you modify the value for the `.spec.host` field, it is not possible to restore the default value that was generated by the OpenShift cluster. After you restore your OpenShift cluster, the operator resets the value for the field.
