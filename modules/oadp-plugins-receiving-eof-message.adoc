= Velero plugins returning "received EOF, stopping recv loop" message

[NOTE]
====
Velero plugins are started as separate processes. Once the Velero operation has completed, either successfully or not, they exit. Therefore, if you see a `received EOF, stopping recv loop` messages in debug logs, it does not mean an error occurred, it means that a plugin operation has completed.
