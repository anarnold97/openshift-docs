[id="csisnapshot-timeout_{context}"]
= CSI snapshot timeout

`CSISnapshotTimeout` specifies the time during creation to wait until  the `CSI VolumeSnapshot` status becomes `ReadyToUse`, before returning error as timeout. The default value is `10m`.

Use the `CSISnapshotTimeout`  for the following scenarios:

* With the CSI plugin.
* For very large storage volumes that may take longer than 10 minutes to snapshot. Adjust this timeout if timeouts are found in the logs.

[IMPORTANT]
.Backup configuration "csiSnapshotTimeout" not functioning as expected
====
In OADP 1.2.0 and 1.2.1, the backup configuration setting `csiSnapshotTimeout` is not functioning as expected. When attempting to modify this parameter to a custom value, the backup process still utilizes the default timeout value instead of the specified one. This behavior persists regardless of the value assigned to `csiSnapshotTimeout`. This issue has been resolved in OADP 1.2.2. 
====

[NOTE]
====
Typically, the default value for `CSISnapshotTimeout` does not require adjustment, because the default setting can accommodate large storage volumes.

.Procedure
