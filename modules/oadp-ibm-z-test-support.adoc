= OADP testing and support for target backup locations using {ibm-z-title}

* {ibm-z-name} running with {product-title} 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, and 4.15, and {oadp-short} {oadp-version-1-2} was tested successfully against an AWS S3 backup location target. Although the test involved only an AWS S3 target, Red Hat supports running {ibm-z-name} with {product-title} 4.12, 4.13, 4.14 and 4.15, and {oadp-short} {oadp-version-1-2} against all S3 backup location targets, which are not AWS, as well.
