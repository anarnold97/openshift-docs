= OADP Data Mover limitations

The built-in Data Mover has the following limitations:

* Both the  Container Storage Interface (CSI) and the CSI snapshot support both the file system volume mode and the block volume mode.

* For OADP 1.3.0, the Data Mover uses a static, common encryption key for all backup repositories it creates. This common encryption key means that anyone who has access to your backup storage can read your backup data.

* The backup data for Data Mover, OADP 1.3.0, can be preserved incrementally. For a single file, the Data Mover utilizes deduplication to identify the difference that can be saved. This means that large files, such as those storing a database, will take a long time to scan for data deduplication.

* When you use the Data Mover for OADP 1.3.0, you might need to change the resource limits to make sure that backups are successful for large big files or a large set of files. big backup sizes.

* The Kopia uploader provides support for the block mode. However, it is limited to non-Windows platforms due to the block mode code triggering system calls that are not present in the Windows platform.
