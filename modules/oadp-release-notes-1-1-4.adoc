[id="known-issues_{context}"]
== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

* Issues restoring an OADP backup, with the application unable to access data. UID / GID range may have changed on the cluster where the application has been restored, with the result that OADP does not backup and restore OpenShift UID/GID range metadata. If the backed application requires a specific UUID, ensure the range is available when restored. Workaround: Allowing OADP to create the namespace while restoring may avoid the issue.

* It is possible that the restore will fail if ArgoCD is used during the restore. This failure could be caused by a label used by ArgoCD `app.kubernetes.io/instance`. This label is used to identify which resources ArgoCD needs to manage, which can create conflict with OADP managing resources on restore. Workaround: setting `.spec.resourceTrackingMethod` on the ArgoCD YAML to `annotation+label` or `annotation`. If the issue continues to persist, then disable ArgoCD before beginning the restore, and enable when the restore has completed.
