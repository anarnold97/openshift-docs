= OADP Operator backup and restore

.Prerequisites

* Source and destination clusters are of the same {OCP} (OCP) or {osd} (OSD) version.

* The 3scale installation has its job queue drained before running the backup.

* The 3scale installation is fully functional at the time of backup.

// * There are two approaches for backing up the system database, as recommended by OADP.

* The operator is restored by re-creating the subscription and operator groups. If you have changed any values of their operator using the CSV, then the operator is not properly recovered.

* This scenario does not use a custom domain; with a custom domain, with custom domain the restoration could be easier as the routes do not have to be updated manually in the database. If a default cluster domain is used, you have to update their domains in the database after the database is migrated.
