.CVE-2023-45288 oadp-operator-container: Golang: net/http, x/net/http2: unlimited number of CONTINUATION frames

A flaw was found in the `HTTP/2` Golang protocol, which impacts previous versions of {oadp-short}. There were insufficient limitations on the amount of `CONTINUATION` frames sent within a single stream. An attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack.

For more details, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2023-45288[CVE-2023-45288].

.CVE-2024-24788 oadp-velero-container: Golang: net: malformed DNS message can cause infinite loop

A flaw was found in the `net` Golang `stlib` package, which impacts previous versions of {oadp-short}. When a malformed DNS message is received as a response to a query, the Lookup functions within the net package can become stuck in an infinite loop. This issue can lead to resource exhaustion, and an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack.

.CVE-2024-24789 oadp-velero-container: Golang: archive/zip: Incorrect handling of certain ZIP files

A flaw was found in the ZIP implementation of the Golang archive/zip library, which impacts previous versions of {oadp-short}. This flaw means that the ZIP implementation behaves differently than the rest of the ZIP file format implementations. When handling ZIP files with a corrupted central directory record, the library skips over the invalid record and processes the next valid one. An attacked could exploit this to access hidden information or files inside maliciously crafted ZIP files.

For more details, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2024-24789[CVE-2024-24789].

.CVE-2024-24790 oadp-velero-container: Golang: net/netip: `Is*()` methods do not behave as expected

A flaw was found in the `net/netip` Golang standard library, which impacts previous versions of {oadp-short}. The methods `Is*()`, `(IsPrivate()`, `IsPublic()`, and so on, do not behave as expected when working with IPv6 mapped to IPv4 addresses. The unexpected behavior can lead to integrity and confidentiality issues, specifically when these methods are used to control access to resources or data.

For more details, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2024-24790[CVE-2024-24790].

.CVE-2024-28180 oadp-kubevirt-velero-plugin-container: jose-go: improper handling of highly compressed data

A flaw was found in JOSE, which impacts previous versions of {oadp-short}. This flaw is caused by the improper handling of highly compressed data, and could allow an attacker to send a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) containing compressed data that uses large amounts of memory and CPU when decompressed by `Decrypt` or `DecryptMulti`.

For more details, see link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2024-28180[CVE-2024-28180].

.Cassandra application pods enter into the `CrashLoopBackoff` status after restoring OADP

After {oadp-short} restores, the Cassandra application pods might enter in the `CrashLoopBackoff` status. To work around this problem, delete the `StatefulSet` pods that are returning an error or the `CrashLoopBackoff` state after restoring {oadp-short}. The `StatefulSet` controller recreates these pods and it runs normally.
