= Velero CPU and memory resource allocations for {VirtProductName}

You set the CPU and memory resource allocations for the `Velero` pod by editing the  `DataProtectionApplication` custom resource (CR) manifest.

.Prerequisites

* You must have the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) Operator installed.

.Procedure

* Edit the values in the `spec.configuration.velero.podConfig.ResourceAllocations` block of the `DataProtectionApplication` CR manifest, as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: oadp.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: DataProtectionApplication
metadata:
  name: <dpa_sample>
spec:
...
  configuration:
    velero:
      podConfig:
        nodeSelector: <node selector> <1>
        resourceAllocations: <2>
          limits:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: 1024Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 200m
            memory: 256Mi
----
<1> Specify the node selector to be supplied to Velero podSpec.
<2> The `resourceAllocations` for backing up {VirtProductName} are most lkely to be more resource intensive than backing up containers. It is advisable to increase the memory and cpu limits.


[NOTE]
====
Kopia is an option in OADP 1.3 and later releases. You can use Kopia for file system backups, and Kopia is your only option for Data Mover cases with the built-in Data Mover.
